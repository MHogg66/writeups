### Check Digit

`"We need a check digit in our keys. What do IMEI numbers, credit card numbers and UIC wagon numbers have in common?"`

`"Flag format: syskronCTF{relevant-ISO/IEC-standard} (e.g., syskronCTF{ISO/IEC-27001})."`

Searching Check digit ISO standard I came across

- ISO/IEC 7064
- ISO/IEC-6346

neither of which were correct

with further research into IMEI I came across [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity#Check_digit_computation)

which had the answer

syskronCTF{ISO/IEC-7812}
