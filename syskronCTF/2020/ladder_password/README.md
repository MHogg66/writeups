### Ladder Password

`"A BB engineer encoded her password in ladder logic. Each "r" can be either 0 or 1 and represents a character in her password. "r1" is the first character, "r2" the second one, and so on. We assume that n1 is a small value and n3 is big. n2 may be between n1 and n3.

Please decode the password to demonstrate that this technique of storing passwords is insecure.

Flag format: r1r2r3…r9r10 (e.g., 0011…011).

Be aware: BB deployed brute-force detection. You only have 3 attempts until lockout!"`

first thing I did is research into ladder logic, as I had never encountered it before: [here](https://www.solisplc.com/tutorials/how-to-read-ladder-logic)
