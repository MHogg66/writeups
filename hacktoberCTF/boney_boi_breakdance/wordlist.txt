the

the
danse
macabre
(/dɑːns
məˈkɑːb(rə)/
french
pronunciation:
​[dɑ̃s
makabʁ])
(from
the
french
language)
also
called
the
dance
of
death
is
an
artistic
genre
of
allegory
of
the
late
middle
ages
on
the
universality
of
death:
no
matter
one's
station
in
life
the
danse
macabre
unites
all

the
danse
macabre
consists
of
the
dead
or
a
personification
of
death
summoning
representatives
from
all
walks
of
life
to
dance
along
to
the
grave
typically
with
a
pope
emperor
king
child
and
laborer
it
was
produced
as
memento
mori
to
remind
people
of
the
fragility
of
their
lives
and
how
vain
were
the
glories
of
earthly
life[1]
its
origins
are
postulated
from
illustrated
sermon
texts;
the
earliest
recorded
visual
scheme
was
a
now-lost
mural
at
holy
innocents'
cemetery
in
paris
dating
from
1424
to
1425

francis
rapp
writes
that
"christians
were
moved
by
the
sight
of
the
infant
jesus
playing
on
his
mother's
knee;
their
hearts
were
touched
by
the
pietà;
and
patron
saints
reassured
them
by
their
presence
but
all
the
while
the
danse
macabre
urged
them
not
to
forget
the
end
of
all
earthly
things"[2]
this
danse
macabre
was
enacted
at
village
pageants
and
at
court
masques
with
people
"dressing
up
as
corpses
from
various
strata
of
society"
and
may
have
been
the
origin
of
costumes
worn
during
allhallowtide[3][4][5][6]

paintings
the
earliest
recorded
visual
example
is
the
lost
mural
on
the
south
wall
of
the
cemetery
of
the
holy
innocents
in
paris
which
was
painted
in
1424–25
during
the
regency
of
john
duke
of
bedford:
with
its
emphatic
inclusion
of
a
dead
crowned
king
at
a
time
when
france
did
not
have
a
crowned
king
the
mural
may
well
have
had
a
political
subtext[7]
there
were
also
painted
schemes
in
basel
(the
earliest
dating
from
c 1440);
a
series
of
paintings
on
canvas
by
bernt

the
deathly
horrors
of
the
14th
century
such
as
recurring
famines
the
hundred
years'
war
in
france
and
most
of
all
the
black
death
were
culturally
assimilated
throughout
europe
the
omnipresent
possibility
of
sudden
and
painful
death
increased
the
religious
desire
for
penance
but
it
also
evoked
a
hysterical
desire
for
amusement
while
still
possible;
a
last
dance
as
cold
comfort
the
danse
macabre
combines
both
desires:
in
many
ways
similar
to
the
mediaeval
mystery
plays
the
dance-with-death
allegory
was
originally
a
didactic
dialogue
poem
to
remind
people
of
the
inevitability
of
death
and
to
advise
them
strongly
to
be
prepared
at
all
times
for
death
(see
memento
mori
and
ars
moriendi)

short
verse
dialogues
between
death
and
each
of
its
victims
which
could
have
been
performed
as
plays
can
be
found
in
the
direct
aftermath
of
the
black
death
in
germany
and
in
spain
(where
it
was
known
as
the
totentanz
and
la
danza
de
la
muerte
respectively)
the
french
term
danse
macabre
may
derive
from
the
latin
chorea
machabæorum
literally
"dance
of
the
maccabees"[8][9]
in
2
maccabees
a
deuterocanonical
book
of
the
bible
the
grim
martyrdom
of
a
mother
and
her
seven
sons
is
described
and
was
a
well-known
mediaeval
subject
it
is
possible
that
the
maccabean
martyrs
were
commemorated
in
some
early
french
plays
or
that
people
just
associated
the
book's
vivid
descriptions
of
the
martyrdom
with
the
interaction
between
death
and
its
prey

an
alternative
explanation
is
that
the
term
entered
france
via
spain
the
arabic:
مقابر‎
maqabir
(pl
"cemeteries")
being
the
root
of
the
word
both
the
dialogues
and
the
evolving
paintings
were
ostensive
penitential
lessons
that
even
illiterate
people
(who
were
the
overwhelming
majority)
could
understand

frescoes
frescoes
and
murals
dealing
with
death
had
a
long
tradition
and
were
widespread
eg
the
legend
of
the
"three
living
and
the
three
dead":
on
a
ride
or
hunt
three
young
gentlemen
meet
three
cadavers
(sometimes
described
as
their
ancestors)
who
warn
them
quod
fuimus
estis;
quod
sumus
vos
eritis
("what
we
were
you
are;
what
we
are
you
will
be")
numerous
mural
versions
of
that
legend
from
the
13th
century
onwards
have
survived
(for
instance
in
the
hospital
church
of
wismar
or
the
residential
longthorpe
tower
outside
peterborough)
since
they
showed
pictorial
sequences
of
men
and
corpses
covered
with
shrouds
those
paintings
are
sometimes
regarded
as
cultural
precursors
of
the
new
genre

a
danse
macabre
painting
may
show
a
round
dance
headed
by
death
or
a
chain
of
alternating
dead
and
live
dancers
from
the
highest
ranks
of
the
mediaeval
hierarchy
(usually
pope
and
emperor)
descending
to
its
lowest
(beggar
peasant
and
child)
each
mortal's
hand
is
taken
by
a
skeleton
or
an
extremely
decayed
body
the
famous
totentanz
by
bernt
notke
in
st
mary's
church
lübeck
(destroyed
during
the
allied
bombing
of
lübeck
in
world
war
ii)
presented
the
dead
dancers
as
very
lively
and
agile
making
the
impression
that
they
were
actually
dancing
whereas
their
living
dancing
partners
looked
clumsy
and
passive
the
apparent
class
distinction
in
almost
all
of
these
paintings
is
completely
neutralized
by
death
as
the
ultimate
equalizer
so
that
a
sociocritical
element
is
subtly
inherent
to
the
whole
genre
the
totentanz
of
metnitz
for
example
shows
how
a
pope
crowned
with
his
mitre
is
being
led
into
hell
by
the
dancing
death

usually
a
short
dialogue
is
attached
to
each
victim
in
which
death
is
summoning
him
(or
more
rarely
her)
to

the
summoned
is
moaning
about

the
famous
designs
by
hans
holbein
the
younger
(1497–1543)
for
his
dance
of
death
series
were
drawn
in
1526
while
he
was
in
basel
they
were
cut
in
wood
by
the
accomplished
formschneider
(block

hans
lützelburger
william
ivins
(quoting
w
j
linton)
writes
of
lützelburger's
work:
"'nothing
indeed
by
knife
or
by
graver
is
of
higher
quality
than
this
man's
doing'
for
by
common
acclaim
the
originals
are
technically
the
most
marvelous
woodcuts
ever
made"[10]
these
woodcuts
soon
appeared
in
proofs
with
titles
in
german
the
first
book
edition
containing
forty-one
woodcuts
was
published
at
lyons
by
the
treschsel
brothers
in
1538
the
popularity
of
the
work
and
the
currency
of
its
message
are
underscored
by
the
fact
that
there
were
eleven
editions
before
1562
and
over
the
sixteenth
century
perhaps
as
many
as
a
hundred
unauthorized
editions
and
imitations[11]
ten
further
designs
were
added
in
later
editions

the
dance
of
death
(1523–26)
refashions
the
late-medieval
allegory
of
the
danse
macabre
as
a
reformist
satire
and
one
can
see
the
beginnings
of
a
gradual
shift
from
traditional
to
reformed
religion[12]
that
shift
had
many
permutations
however
and
in
a
study
natalie
zemon
davis
has
shown
that
the
contemporary
reception
and
afterlife
of
holbein's
designs
lent
themselves
to
neither
purely
catholic
or
protestant
doctrine
but
could
be
outfitted
with
different
surrounding
prefaces
and
sermons
as
printers
and
writers
of
different
political
and
religious
leanings
took
them
up
most
importantly
"the
pictures
and
the
bible
quotations
above
them
were
the
main
attractions
[…]
both
catholics
and
protestants
wished
through
the
pictures
to
turn
men's
thoughts
to
a
christian
preparation
for
death"[13]

the
1538
edition

contained
latin
quotations
from
the
bible
above
holbein's
designs

by

employs
a

and
a

and
the

before

in
which
these

barge
in

in

disguises
confronting
individuals
from
all
walks
of
life
none
escape
death's
skeletal
clutches
not
even
the
pious[17]
as
davis
writes
"holbein's
pictures
are
independent
dramas
in
which
death
comes
upon
his
victim
in
the
midst
of
the
latter's
own
surroundings
and
activities[18]
this
is
perhaps
nowhere
more
strikingly
captured
than
in
the
wonderful
blocks
showing
the
plowman
earning
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
only
to
have
his
horses
speed
him
to
his
end
by
death
the
latin
from
the
1549
italian
edition
pictured
here
reads:
"in
sudore
vultus
tui
vesceris
pane
tuo"
("through
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
you
shall
eat
your
bread")
quoting
genesis
319
the
italian
verses
below
translate:
("miserable
in
the
sweat
of
your
brow/
it
is
necessary
that
you
acquire
the
bread
you
need
eat/
but
may
it
not
displease
you
to
come
with
me/
if
you
are
desirous
of
rest")
or
there
is
the
nice
balance
in
composition
holbein
achieves
between
the
heavy-laden
traveling
salesman
insisting
that
he
must
still
go
to
market
while
death
tugs
at
his
sleeve
to
put
down
his
wares
once
and
for
all:
"venite
ad
me
qui
onerati
estis"
("come
to
me
all
ye
who
[labor
and]
are
heavy
laden")
quoting
matthew
1128
the
italian
here
translates:
("come
with
me
wretch
who
are
weighed
down/
since
i
am
the

has
received
numerous

schubert's

since
the
16th
century
costumes
have
become
a
central
part
of
halloween
traditions
perhaps
the
most
common
traditional
halloween
costume
is
that
of
the
ghost
this
is
likely
because

when
halloween
customs
began
to
be
influenced
by
catholicism
the
incorporation
of
the
themes
of
all
hallows'
and
all
souls'
day
would
have
emphasized
visitations
from
the
spirit
world
over
the
motifs
of
spirites
and
fairies

the
baking
and
allowing
them
to
go
door
to
door
to
collect
them
in
exchange
for
praying
for
the
dead
(a
practice
called
souling)
often
carrying
lanterns
made
of
hollowed-out
turnips
around
the
16th
century
the
practice
of
going
house
to
house
in
disguise
(a
practice
called
guising)
to
ask
for
food
began
and
was
often
accompanied
by
recitation
of
traditional
verses
(a
practice
called
mumming)
wearing
costumes
another
tradition
has
many
possible
explanations
such
as
it
was
done
to
confuse
the
spirits
or
souls
who
visited
the
earth
or
who
rose
from
local
graveyards
to
engage
in
what
was
called
a
danse
macabre

a
large
party

the

another
contributor
to
the
custom
of
dressing
up
at
halloween
was
the
old
irish
practice
of
marking
all
hallows'
day
with
religious
pageants
that
recounted
biblical
events
these
were
common
during
the
middle
ages
all
across
europe
the
featured
players
dressed
as
saints
and
angels
but
there
were
also
plenty
of
roles
for
demons
who
had
more
fun
capering
acting
devilish
and
playing
to
the
crows
the
pageant
began
inside
the
church
then
moved
by
procession
to
the
churchyard
where
it
continued
long
into
the
night
