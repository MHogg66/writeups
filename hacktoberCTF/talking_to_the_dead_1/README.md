### Talking to the dead 1

`ssh hacktober@env.hacktober.io`
pw `hacktober-Underdog-Truth-Glimpse`

so first I recursively searched with grep to see what I could find

`grep -rl flag /`bash

and found some interesting files
/home/luciafer/Documents/.flag2.txt
/home/luciafer/Documents/flag1.txt
/home/spookyboi/Documents/flag3.txt

for this challenge all we need is flag1.txt

cating file we get

flag{cb07e9d6086d50ee11c0d968f1e5c4bf1c89418c}
