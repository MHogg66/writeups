### Mahatma 

we are given the only clue

"Which Lisbon Mayor permanently brought the most famous Mahatma to Lisbon?"

thought of a statue. 

I found the statue [here](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/70/7a/ca/mahatma-gandhi-sculpture.jpg)

Looking up the mayor in year we get the flag, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Lisbon)
